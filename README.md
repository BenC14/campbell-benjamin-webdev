# Web Dev Summer 2017

My name is Ben Campbell and I am a student at Northeastern University in the College of Computer Science. I have worked on several programming teams on co-op but this will be my first solo web development project.

The purpose of this repo is to be a learning space for the MEAN web development stack.
